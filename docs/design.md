Two Designs I would like to implement
--
I would like to add heuristic 4 to my webpage, adding a header for ease of use and gettting around the site easier. Navigation is a plus on webpages

Another one I would like to add is number 8, keeping my webpage as simple as possible. They should be able to see the page and maybe a few quizzes and then start a quiz.
They can look at the header and see what the page is about and so on and so forth
